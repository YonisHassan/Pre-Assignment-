## Quick Reference Notes

## FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

### Service Management

**Definition:** A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers through services.

**Purpose:** To ensure that IT services are managed efficiently and economically to support business needs, not just keep systems running.

**Key Insight:** IT should be viewed as a service business, not just a technical function. Everything should focus on creating value for customers.

### Value

**Core Principle:** Value is always defined by the customer, not the provider. It's about what the customer perceives as beneficial.

**Creating Value:** Value is co-created through active collaboration between provider and consumer. Both parties must work together.

### Services, Products, and Offerings

**Service:** A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.

**Product:** A configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for customers.

**Service Offering:** A description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. May include goods, access to resources, and service actions.

### Service Relationships

**Definition:** Cooperation between a service provider and service consumer, including service provision, service consumption, and service relationship management.

**Key Roles:**
- **Service Provider:** Organization that provides services
- **Service Consumer:** Organization or person that receives services (includes customers, users, and sponsors)

### Outcomes, Costs, and Risks

**Outcomes:** Results for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs. What the customer actually wants to achieve.

**Costs:** The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource. Services must balance costs for both provider and consumer.

**Risks:** Possible events that could cause harm or loss, or make it harder to achieve objectives. Services must help mitigate consumer risks while managing provider risks.

### Utility and Warranty

The two dimensions that define service value:

**Utility (Fit for Purpose):** The functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Does it do what it's supposed to do?

**Warranty (Fit for Use):** Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Can you rely on it to work when needed?

**Warranty includes:** Availability, capacity, security, and continuity.

**_Critical Point:_** _A service must have BOTH utility and warranty to create value. One without the other is insufficient._

## ITIL 4 FRAMEWORK

### Four Dimensions of Service Management

Every aspect of service management must be considered from four perspectives:

**1. Organizations and People**
- Organizational structure, roles, responsibilities, culture, required competencies, and communication.

**2. Information and Technology**
- Information and knowledge needed to manage services, plus the technologies that support service management.

**3. Partners and Suppliers**
- Relationships with other organizations involved in design, development, deployment, delivery, support, and improvement of services.

**4. Value Streams and Processes**
- How the organization's activities work together to create value. The workflows and procedures that enable productivity.

_**Remember:** All four dimensions must be balanced. Neglecting any dimension will result in suboptimal service._

### Service Value System (SVS)

**Definition:** Describes how all the components and activities of an organization work together as a system to enable value creation.

**Components of the SVS:**
- **Guiding Principles** - Recommendations that guide decisions and actions
- **Governance** - How the organization is directed and controlled
- **Service Value Chain** - Activities that transform inputs into outputs
- **Practices** - Sets of organizational resources for performing work
- **Continual Improvement** - Recurring activity at all levels

### The Seven Guiding Principles

Universal recommendations that guide organizations in all circumstances:

**1. Focus on Value**
- Everything should link back to value for stakeholders. Always understand who the service consumer is and what they value.

**2. Start Where You Are**
- Don't start from scratch without considering what's already available. Assess the current state objectively.

**3. Progress Iteratively with Feedback**
- Work in small, manageable sections using feedback loops. Don't try to do everything at once.

**4. Collaborate and Promote Visibility**
- Work together across boundaries. Make work visible to understand the flow and identify bottlenecks.

**5. Think and Work Holistically**
- No service stands alone. Consider how different parts of the organization integrate and collaborate.

**6. Keep It Simple and Practical**
- Use minimum number of steps to accomplish objectives. Eliminate anything that doesn't contribute to value.

**7. Optimize and Automate**
- Use technology to best effect. Optimize before you automate - don't automate a broken process.

### Service Value Chain

**Definition:** An operating model that outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value realization through the creation and management of products and services.

**The Six Activities:**

**Plan**
- Ensure shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions.

**Improve**
- Ensure continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities.

**Engage**
- Provide good understanding of stakeholder needs, transparency, and continual engagement with all stakeholders.

**Design and Transition**
- Ensure products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, costs, and time to market.

**Obtain/Build**
- Ensure service components are available when and where needed, meeting agreed specifications.

**Deliver and Support**
- Ensure services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications and stakeholder expectations.

_**Key Point:** These activities are interconnected and can be combined in different ways to create value streams specific to your organization._

### Continual Improvement

**Purpose:** To align practices and services with changing business needs through ongoing improvement of products, services, and practices.

**Continual Improvement Model:**
1. **What is the vision?** - Understand high-level direction
2. **Where are we now?** - Assess current state
3. **Where do we want to be?** - Define the target state
4. **How do we get there?** - Plan the improvements
5. **Take action** - Execute improvement initiatives
6. **Did we get there?** - Evaluate and learn
7. **How do we keep the momentum going?** - Sustain improvements

**Remember:** Improvement should happen at all levels - strategic, tactical, and operational. Everyone is responsible for improvement.

### The 34 ITIL Practices

**Definition:** Sets of organizational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.

**Three Categories:**

**General Management Practices (14)**
- Adapted from general business management: architecture management, continual improvement, information security management, knowledge management, measurement and reporting, organizational change management, portfolio management, project management, relationship management, risk management, service financial management, strategy management, supplier management, workforce and talent management.

**Service Management Practices (17)**
- Specific to service management: availability management, business analysis, capacity and performance management, change enablement, incident management, IT asset management, monitoring and event management, problem management, release management, service catalogue management, service configuration management, service continuity management, service design, service desk, service level management, service request management, service validation and testing.

**Technical Management Practices (3)**
- Technology-specific: deployment management, infrastructure and platform management, software development and management.

_**Note:** The introductory course provides an overview. Deep knowledge of all 34 practices requires further study of ITIL 4 Foundation and beyond._
